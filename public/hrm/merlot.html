			<p>Merlot Grapes are a strain of <i>Vitis vinifera</i> that was originally cultivated in Bordeaux, France.</p>
			<p>Merlot is grown throughout the world, being used in single grape wines and as a blending grape.</p>
			<p>It is the most widely grown grape in Bordeaux, being used mostly as a blending grape for Bordeaux wines.</p>
			<p>It is also grown in the South of France, much of Eastern Europe, Chile*, much of the US, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand.</p>
			<p>*Chile is a notable case, as when the country tried to adopt the Bordeaux style blend they began cultivating what they thought was Merlot, but was actually Carmen√®re, a close relative of Merlot.</p>
			<p>Merlot's aroma profile varies slightly based on the climate it is grown in, from red plum and cherry in colder areas to blackberry and fruitcake in warmer areas.</p>
			<p>Generally, Merlot has tastes of cherry, chocolate, and vanilla.</p>
			<p>Merlot is very smooth due to its high alcohol content and medium tannins. It has a medium to full body, a medium acidity, and is bone dry.</p>
			<p>Merlot is the 2nd most planted grape variety in the world, second only to Cabernet Sauvignon. Compared to the other wines I covered, it is fairly young, with it first being documented in the late 18th century.</p>
