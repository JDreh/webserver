			<p>Riesling is a very aromatic grape. It is known for its floral and citrus aromas.</p>
			<p>It is also known for its high acidity. It has a very light body and is usually very low in alcohol. Because it is a white wine, it has no tannins. Its sweetness can range from dry to off-dry.</p>
			<p>Riesling's first documented appearance is from the 15th century, it was suspected to have grown in the vineyards along the Rhine river. It is known to be a very terroir expressive wine, taking a lot from the soils and climates it was grown in. It is suited to sandy clay and slate soils, and its fruitier aromas are expressed more when grown in colder climates.</p>
