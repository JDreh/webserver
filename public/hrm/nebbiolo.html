			<p>Nebbiolo Grapes are a strain of <i>Vitis vinifera</i> that was originally cultivated in Piedmont, Italy.</p>
			<p>Nebbiolo is mainly grown in Piedmont.</p>
			<p>Outside of Piedmont, Nebbiolo is grown in California, Mexico, and Australia.</p>
			<p>Out of all the red grapes, Nebbiolo has a very light, delicate smell. It has aromas of red fruits and roses.</p>
			<p>However, when you taste it, that goes out the window. It has very earthy flavors, like clay and leather, but lighter flavors of cherry as well.</p>
			<p>Nebbiolo is a very tannic wine, has a strong body, high acidity, and is very dry. Notably, it is has a pale to medium ruby color.</p>
			<p>Nebbiolo is very rarely grown outside of Italy, with more of it being produced in Italy than anywhere else in the world; however, it makes up roughly 8% of the total grapes produced in Italy. Nebbiolo is very terroir expressive, picking up more from the soil it is grown in than other red grapes. The word <i>Nebbiolo</i> comes from the Italian word nebbia, which mean fog, which is likely due to the natural bloom of yeast that appears during its harvest season.</p>
